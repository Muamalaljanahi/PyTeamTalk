# PyTeamTalk

A human-friendly wrapper around the Teamtalk 5 TCP API.

It facilitates the process of creating TeamTalk bots and controllers, many times in only a couple lines of code. Forget the logistics, just build.

## Installation

This code has been tested and confirmed to work under python 3.8, though it probably does so just as well under other 3* versions.

Installing from source:

```
git clone http://github.com/cartertemm/pyteamtalk
cd pyteamtalk
pip install .
```

Alternatively, simply copy the directory and start hacking. There are no dependencies.

## Todo

The following still needs to be done

* Handle subscription changes
* Support sending and receiving files
* Support encrypted servers
* Support servers where users are unable to see other users
* Add to pip
